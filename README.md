# MyReads
This App will help you keep track of your reading-progress. You can put books in three different shelves: Currently Reading, Want To Read or Read. New books can be added by pressing the green + button at the bottom right which takes you to the search. (Please have a look at the section "Reduced Search" on this page.)
MyReads is an App for Udacitys React Nanodegree.

## Installation
You need [npm](https://nodejs.org/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) on your machine. Simply clone this project with [git](https://git-scm.com/) or download it as a ZIP. To unzip the file you need a tool like "unzip", "7-Zip" or WinZip). The npm/yarn commands might need sudo/root permissions on your system.

Steps with git in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/maczarr/MyReads.git
cd MyReads
npm install
npm start
```

or after downloading the ZIP-File using unzip from the directory where the download was saved:
```
unzip MyReads-master.zip
cd MyReads-master
npm install
npm start
```

## Reduced Search
There is only a fixed set of search results and it is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
