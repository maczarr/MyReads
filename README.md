# MyReads
App for Udacitys React Nanodegree

## Installation
You need [npm](https://nodejs.org/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) on your machine. Simply clone this project with [git](https://git-scm.com/) or download it as a ZIP. From the projects root directory call `npm install` and `npm run start` or with yarn its just `yarn` and `yarn start`.
That's it!

## Reduced Search
There is only a fixed set of search results and it is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## What is this?
This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

## Contributing
